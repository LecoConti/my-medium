# Development Backlog

This comprehensive backlog is aligned with the functional specification and screen navigation requirements defined in the prd-spec folder. Each story includes acceptance criteria, technical notes, and dependencies to support progressive development across 8 releases.

Rules to be applied in the backlog management:
- The development must follow the back-log order.
- When a story is taken to be developed, it must be marked (after the story name), as "being developed"
- Whe completed, the story must be removed from this file and moved with the same content to the file plan/bkl-completed.md including the associated release info.

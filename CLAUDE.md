# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a Medium-like content publishing platform for articles. The repository is currently in its initial state with only specification placeholders.

## Architecture Notes
- This is a greenfield project - no existing codebase structure has been established yet
- The prd-spec/ directory contains empty specification files that may define requirements

## Development Setup
No package manager or build system has been configured yet. When implementing:
- Choose appropriate technology stack (likely React/Next.js for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend)
- Set up package.json with necessary dependencies
- Configure build, lint, and test scripts

## Key Considerations for Implementation
- Design for article creation, editing, and publishing workflows
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Create responsive article reading experience
- Plan for content management and moderation features
- Consider SEO optimization for published articles
